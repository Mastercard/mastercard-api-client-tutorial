  title: MDES for Merchants
  description: |
    The MDES APIs are designed as RPC style stateless web services where each API endpoint represents an operation to be performed.  All request and response payloads are sent in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data-interchange format. Each endpoint in the API specifies the HTTP Method used to access it. All strings in request and response objects are to be UTF-8 encoded.  Each API URI includes the major and minor version of API that it conforms to.  This will allow multiple concurrent versions of the API to be deployed simultaneously.
    <br>
    __Authentication__
    Mastercard uses OAuth 1.0a with body hash extension for authenticating the API clients. This requires every request that you send to 
    Mastercard to be signed with an RSA private key. A private-public RSA key pair must be generated consisting of: <br>
    1 . A private key for the OAuth signature for API requests. It is recommended to keep the private key in a password-protected or hardware keystore.
    <br>
    2. A public key is shared with Mastercard during the project setup process through either a certificate signing request (CSR) or the API Key Generator. Mastercard will use the public key to verify the OAuth signature that is provided on every API call.<br>

    An OAUTH1.0a signer library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/oauth1-signer-java)
    <br> 
    __Encryption__<br>
    
    All communications between Issuer web service and the Mastercard gateway is encrypted using TLS.
    <br>
    __Additional Encryption of Sensitive Data__
    In addition to the OAuth authentication, when using MDES Digital Enablement Service, any PCI sensitive and all account holder Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data must be encrypted. This requirement applies to the API fields containing encryptedData. Sensitive data is encrypted using a symmetric session (one-time-use) key. The symmetric session key is then wrapped with an RSA Public Key supplied by Mastercard during API setup phase (the Customer Encryption Key). <br>

        This API is used to retrieve static Assets from MDES’s repository, such

        Conditions. Every Asset in the repository is referenced using an Asset
        ID. Once an Asset has been assigned to an Asset ID, the contents of the
        Asset will not change. If contents do need to change (for example,
        Issuer has supplied new artwork for a product), they will be updated in
        the repository and be assigned a new Asset ID.  Different types of
        Assets are supported in the repository, such as images and text files;
        and for each type of Asset, multiple formats may be supported. For
        example, a single image Asset may be supported in various file formats;
        or variant sizes, allowing the Token Requestor to select the most
        appropriate format to use for a particular target device.

        Mastercard will connect via TLS protocol and verify the server
        certificate before establishing a connection to the client endpoint.
        During this handshake, the client server can request TLS client
        authentication. Mastercard will present a client certificate which
        identifies as “ws.mastercard.com” This client certificate is issued by
        the Entrust L1K certificate and should be available in most trust
        stores.

        __Conditional Objects__<br>

        associated FPAN have changed (such as token or PAN expiry).  
         
         The optional objects will always contain a minimum set of data which be returned regardless of whether or not updates have been made. These fields are denoted as required fields.<br>
